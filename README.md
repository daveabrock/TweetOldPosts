# Tweet Old Posts

This repository is a simple .NET app that tweets old posts from my site, daveabrock.com.

This code was mostly ~~stolen~~ inspired by Khalid Abuhakmeh's post, [Automate Blogs with GitHub Actions](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/automate-your-blog-with-github-actions). The only main difference is using the [Tweetinvi library](https://github.com/linvi/tweetinvi).

To customize it to your liking, you'll need to sign up for a Twitter Developer Account, and add secrets to your repository configuration.
